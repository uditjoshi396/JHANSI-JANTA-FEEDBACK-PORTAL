# Janata Feedback Portal - React Client

## Setup
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. The client expects the backend to run at http://localhost:5000

## Notes
- This is a minimal UI to demonstrate the API integration.
- You can expand it with Bootstrap, role-specific dashboards (admin/officer), file upload, and pagination.
